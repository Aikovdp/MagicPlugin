# Materials that must attach to another material when cloning or replicating
# These are done in a second pass so they attach properly after whatever they've
# attached to has copied over.
# This also prevents server issues when trying to clone items that will not "stick",
# which results in spawning thousands (or more) of item entities when they break and drop.
