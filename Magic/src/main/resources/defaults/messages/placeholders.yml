# Custom placeholders can be defined here
# They are used with a magic_ prefix, such as %magic_hotbar%
# Note that these are probably bad examples since they use chat components
# that won't be parsed by whatever is reading this placeholder.
placeholders:
  hotbar: $hotbar
  nathanwolf: '`<icon key="nathanwolf">`'
