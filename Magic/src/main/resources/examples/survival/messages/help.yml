        &6Spell points&f are earned whenever a player &osuccessfully&f casts a spell. For most spells, &bsuccess&f is determined by hitting a valid mob or player target.
        &6Spell points&f have a &ecooldown &ffor earning. This cooldown is specific to each spell, and defaults to &e15 minutes&f.
        &fThe &6Magic Missile&f spell is a special case, it allows for faster SP earning at the start to get palyers going.
        &fOnce players have more than one spell they can earn SP much faster by using all of their spells frequently.
