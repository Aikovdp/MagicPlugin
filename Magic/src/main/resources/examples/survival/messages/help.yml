        `<p>`&6Spell points&f have a &ecooldown &ffor earning. This cooldown is specific to each spell, and defaults to &e15 minutes&f.
        `<p>`The &6Magic Missile&f spell is a special case, it allows for faster SP earning at the start to get palyers going.
        `<p>`Once players have more than one spell they can earn SP much faster by using all of their spells frequently.
